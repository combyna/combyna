        #
        # A special return type determiner is used here, as the result type of the concatenation
        # depends on the types of the elements in each of the lists provided as an argument.
        # eg. if:
        # - the `lists` arg is a list with two sub-lists,
        # - the first list's elements are all texts (list<text>)
        # - the second list's elements are all numbers (list<number>)
        # then the return type of the function is a list where the elements are text and numbers (list<text|number>)
